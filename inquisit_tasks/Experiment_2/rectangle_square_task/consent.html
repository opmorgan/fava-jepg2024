<h3>What we will ask you to do</h3>
You will be asked to perform a brief task which may include: reading words or sentences, naming pictures, learning about objects or sounds, and making judgments about words, pictures, or sounds. The tasks
may involve reading and looking at pictures, or hearing words or sounds through headphones. You may be asked to make responses by pressing keys, speaking aloud, and/or filling out questionnaires.
