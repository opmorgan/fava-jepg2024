      Okay—you're half way there!

      For the second half of the experiment, please press the
      <strong>"/" (slash)</strong> key with your <strong>right index finger</strong>,
      whenever you see either a circle or a square.
      Please keep your eyes focused on the center of the screen.
      We know this task is a little repetitive—please do your best! A few more minutes
      of your attention can help us answer important questions about the human mind.

      Press the spacebar to begin a practice run.
      We'll let you know whether you've responded correctly.
      Be sure to respond as quickly as possible—if you take longer than
      2 seconds to respond to a circle or a square,
      your response will be counted as incorrect (too slow).
