But I can't remember if both tasks were in the same study like this. I also don't remember switching the same finger from 'z' to '/'. I can quite confidently say I have never done an IDENTICAL task to this in its entirety.	384426	Just to confirm that I always use a mouse with my right hand. I don't know if that is standard for left handed people, I do most things left-handed. Also wishing you good luck and all the best with your research.	200226
